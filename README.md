# Magic Formula Investing Tracker

The purpose of this repository is to track investment returns over long term. 
Magic formula is a strategy created by Joel Greenblatt. It's a hybrid quantitative model that incorporates Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett's value ivesting approach. 
Since backtesting of Magic Formula investing apprach has shown significant outperformance of the market (24%), I created this tracker to track the performance for the long term. Please note, in recent years, the magic formula has actually lagged the market. The purpose of this tracker is only due to curiosity. The performance will be shared on @magicformulainv

Magic Formula Investing Rules: 
1) Buy ~30 stocks based on the magic formula filter. For the sake of 
simplicity, will buy all of these stocks at once rather than accumulating over several months. It's assumed the stocks are held in tax-free account to avoid complexity of having to sell loss on 364th day and gains on 366th day.  

2) Replace all stocks on 366th day with the new list from magicformula site
